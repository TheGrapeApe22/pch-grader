Edit the roster file in the first line of code, if necessary.
Ignore the garbage folder, it's garbage.
Run grader3.py (python3) and enter lines in this format:
[name or initials] [score]
 - The score will default to 5 if not entered.
 - Currently, only the first token will be read for name, I'll fix this later.

Finally, type "generate" (or other keywords you might snipe in the grader3.py code) to write an output file to out.txt :P
